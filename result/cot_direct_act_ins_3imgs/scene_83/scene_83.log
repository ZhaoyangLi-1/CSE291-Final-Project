- First, we need to locate the tomato and the microwave.
- In the images, we can see tomato 1 on countertop 1 and microwave 1 next to it.
- The task requires heating the sliced tomato, but there is no action available for slicing the tomato, so we will assume it is already sliced or that the action of slicing is not necessary for the completion of the task.
- (ii): [BEGIN](42): put tomato 1 in/on microwave 1[END]

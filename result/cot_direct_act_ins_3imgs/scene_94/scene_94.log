- After opening the drawer, the agent can then pick up the keychain and place it in the drawer.
- (ii): [BEGIN](9): put keychain 2 in/on drawer 2[END]
- The agent would then need to find another keychain, which is not visible in the current scene, so it would need to go to another location to find it.
- (iii): [BEGIN](5): go to drawer 3[END]
- Assuming the agent finds another keychain in drawer 3, it would then pick it up.
- (iv): [BEGIN](7): open drawer 2[END] (if it was closed after the first keychain was placed)
- Finally, the agent would put the second keychain in the drawer with the first one.
- (v): [BEGIN](9): put keychain 2 in/on drawer 2[END] (assuming 'keychain 2' refers to any keychain and not a specific one)

Since the image shows a wooden dresser with a purple pillow on top, and there are no keychains or other objects visible in the image, it is likely that the keychains are stored in the dresser, specifically in the drawer. By checking the drawer, it would be possible to find and retrieve the keychains and place them in the dresser.

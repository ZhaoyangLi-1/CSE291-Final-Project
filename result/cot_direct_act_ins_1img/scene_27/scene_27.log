- Since the task is to "put some tennisracket on desk", we first need to find a tennis racket. However, there is no tennis racket visible in the image, and none of the actions listed involve picking up a tennis racket. Therefore, we cannot directly complete the task with the given options.
- (ii): The only actions related to a desk are (20) take creditcard 1 from desk 1, (21) take pencil 1 from desk 1, (22) take creditcard 2 from desk 1, (23) use desklamp 1, and (24) examine desk 1. None of these actions will result in putting a tennis racket on the desk.
- (iii): Since no action allows us to pick up a tennis racket, the best course of action might be to examine the desk to see if there are any further clues or if the tennis racket is perhaps hidden or not visible from the current perspective.

- Identify relevant objects in the image related to the task: In the image, we can see a toaster and a coffee machine on the countertop, but no potatoes, microwave, fridge, or sink are visible.
- Evaluate each action's potential to successfully complete the task: Since the task is to put a clean potato in the microwave, the agent would first need to go to the fridge to potentially get a potato (if that's where they are stored), then go to the sink to clean it, and finally go to the microwave to put the potato in.

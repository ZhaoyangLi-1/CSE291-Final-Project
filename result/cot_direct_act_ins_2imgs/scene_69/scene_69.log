- First, we need to find an egg, but there is no egg visible in the fridge. We should check other places where an egg might be stored.
- (ii): Since we can't see an egg in the fridge, we should look in the cabinets or drawers where eggs are commonly stored. However, we don't have an action available to "take egg," so we can't proceed with the task as described.
- (iii): Without the egg, we cannot heat it in the microwave or place it on the countertop.

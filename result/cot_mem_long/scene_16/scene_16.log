Earlier Memory Attempt:
In the initial attempts, three key actions were taken involving instance objects: shelf 1, book 1, and bed 1. The first action was to go to shelf 1, where a book and a pencil were found. The second action involved successfully taking book 1 from shelf 1. The third action was to go to bed 1, where various items were found, but not the previously picked up book 1. 
These actions collectively contribute to the task of placing a book on the bed. However, the task is not yet complete as book 1 has not been placed on bed 1.

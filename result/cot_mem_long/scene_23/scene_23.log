<image>
- Action Taken: go to tvstand 1
- Resulting Observation: You arrive at loc 9. On the tvstand 1, you see a television 1, a statue 1, a creditcard 1, and a keychain 1.
Interact with a household to solve a task. At begining, you are in the middle of a room. looking quickly around you, you see a armchair 1, a ottoman 1, a sofa 1, a sidetable 1, a drawer 1, a diningtable 1, a garbagecan 1, a shelf 1, a shelf 2, a tvstand 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 4, a shelf 5, a shelf 6, a shelf 7, and a shelf 8. You have 1 sets of current tried attempts, and each attempt consists of an action, an image of the action after it happened, and a resulting observation.

**You also have the summary of previously tried attempts:** 
No the summary of previously tried attempts.

**For the task: 'put a keychain in drawer', you need to do**:
a. Analyze the impact of each current tried attempt including the image, resulting observation, and taken action on the task.
b. Combine the summary of previously tried attempts and the analysis of currently tried attempts to give a suggestion of the next step to complete the task.

**Response**: 
Let's think step-by-step.

Current Attempts Reflect:
a. The current attempt shows that the action taken was to go to the tvstand 1, and the resulting observation is that there is a keychain 1 on the tvstand 1. This is a useful observation because the task is to put a keychain in a drawer, and we have now located a keychain.
b. Since there is no summary of previously tried attempts, we only have the current attempt to analyze. Based on the current attempt, the next step to complete the task would be to pick up the keychain 1 from the tvstand 1 and then find a drawer to put it in. The image shows that there is a drawer 1 in the room, so the suggestion for the next step would be to go to the drawer 1, open it if necessary, and place the keychain 1 inside to complete the task.

Earlier Memory Attempt:
In the narrative, three attempts were made involving two instance objects: tvstand 1 and drawer 1. In the first attempt, the action was to approach tvstand 1, resulting in the discovery of a keychain. The second attempt involved successfully obtaining the keychain from tvstand 1. The third attempt was to approach drawer 1, which was found to be closed. The combined effect of these actions brought the keychain closer to its intended location, drawer 1, but the task could not be completed due to the drawer's closed state. The future strategy suggested involves opening drawer 1 and placing the keychain inside it. This strategy directly pertains to the instance objects, as it involves manipulating the state of drawer 1 to complete the task.
